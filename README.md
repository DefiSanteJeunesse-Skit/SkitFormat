# Trialogue

Trialogue is a Twine Story Format based on [Paloma](http://mcdemarco.net/tools/scree/paloma/).

## Development Setup

1. Story Author works on story in [Twinery GUI](https://twinery.org/2/#!/stories), with current version of published Story Format selected
2. Story Author exports updated version of Story to `.html` file and sends it over *(infrequently)*
3. Format Developer decompiles the latest Story version from `.html` to `.twee` using [TweeGo](https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/)/[Twee2](https://dan-q.github.io/twee2/) *(see 'Testing during development')*
4. Format Developer runs [TweeGo](https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/)/[Twee2](https://dan-q.github.io/twee2/) to compile the latest Story from `.twee` to `.html` with WIP/'in development' version of custom Story Format *(see 'Testing during development')*
5. Format Developer adjusts Story Format *(frequently)*
6. Format Developer repeats from step **4.** until I'm happy with to release a new version of Story Format
7. Format Developer publishs Story Format as a new version *(infrequently)*
8. Story Author imports the new version of the Story Format and continues working on the Story
9. Repeat from **1.** until happy with Story Format functionality
10. ðŸŽ‰

### Testing during development

A way to test the result of adjustments to the Story Format, is to compile a `.twee` Story to `.html` using the Trialogue format and check the behaviour & styling in a browser.

Compilation can be done using one of:

- [TweeGo](https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/)
- [Twee2](https://dan-q.github.io/twee2/)

**Decompile** `.html` story to `.twee`/`.tw2` using trialogue story format:

```
tweego --decompile --output=[path/to/target.twee] [path/to/source.html]
```

```
twee2 decompile [path/to/source.html] [path/to/target.tw2]
```

**Compile** `.twee`/`.tw2` story to `.html` story using trialogue story format:

```
tweego --format=Trialogue --output=[path/to/target.html] [path/to/source.twee]
```

```
twee2 build [path/to/source.tw2] [path/to/target.html] --format=./dist/Twine2/Trialogue
```

# Paloma

Paloma is a Jonah-style story format for Twine 1 and 2 based on [Snowman](https://bitbucket.org/klembot/snowman-2/) by Chris Klimas.

Paloma uses Markdown rather than TiddlyWiki-style text formatting, and Javascript rather than Twine 1.x-style macros for scripting, so it is not a drop-in replacement for Jonah.  It is a drop-in replacement for Snowman, except that Paloma will ignore any checkpoints in your story.

The Paloma page is [here](http://mcdemarco.net/tools/scree/paloma/).

View a demo story [here](http://mcdemarco.net/tools/scree/test-paloma.html).

To add Paloma to Twine 2, use this URL (under Formats > Add a New Format): [https://mcdemarco.net/tools/scree/paloma/format.js](https://mcdemarco.net/tools/scree/paloma/format.js).

To add Paloma to Twine 1, create a new folder called `paloma` inside your targets folder, then download this file: [https://mcdemarco.net/tools/scree/paloma/header.html](https://mcdemarco.net/tools/scree/paloma/header.html) and place it inside the `paloma` folder.   (See the [Twine wiki](http://twinery.org/wiki/twine1:story_format#adding_formats) for more information about installing and using story formats in Twine 1.)

## Changes From Snowman

Paloma displays a running log of all passages, like Jonah.  All story links from previous passages are disabled, and the previously selected link is highlighted.

By default, clicking a passage link adds an entry to the reader's browser history.  The reader can back up through this history, but cannot go forward again (except by clicking story links again).  Paloma does not have Snowman's checkpoint functionality; history is node-by-node only.

There is an inline title at the beginning of the story, as well as an optional subtitle and byline below the title.  To add a subtitle, use the special passage `StorySubtitle`.  To add an author, use `StoryAuthor`.  (The title is handled as usual for your version of Twine.)

To restyle or remove the title, use the selector `#ptitle`.    To restyle or remove the subtitle, use the selectors `#psub` (for both), `#psubtitle` (for the subtitle), and `#pauthor` (for the byline).  See [my website](http://mcdemarco.net/tools/scree/paloma/) for styling examples.

### Non-changes from Snowman

Paloma uses [Marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked/) for Markdown formatting and [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) for scripting and templating.

As in Snowman, state is rewound on navigating back.

Some basic Snowman scripting:

* Set a state variable `gender`:  `<% s.gender = "male" %>`.
* Show the variable's value:  `<%= s.gender %>`.
* Show some text based on a variable's value:  `<% if (s.gender == "male") { %>You are male.<% } %>`.
* Show alternate texts based on a variable's value:  `<% if (s.gender == "male") { %>You are male.<% } else { %>You are female.<% } %>`.
* Add a comment: `/* My ToDo list for this node: spellcheck! */`

See [the Snowman docs](https://bitbucket.org/klembot/snowman-2/) for more details.
