# Trialogue

![Trialogue logo](src/icon.svg)

Trialogue is a chat-style Twine Story Format based on [Paloma](http://mcdemarco.net/tools/scree/paloma/), which is in turn based on [Snowman](https://github.com/videlais/snowman).

## How to make a scripted chat experience in Twine using Trialogue

### Import Trialogue into Twine

![trialogue import](/docs/trialogue-import.gif)

1. Open the online [Twine editor](http://twinery.org/2/#!/stories).
2. Choose `Formats` -> `Add a New Format`, paste the Story Format URL (https://phivk.github.io/trialogue/dist/Twine2/Trialogue/format.js) into the input field, click `Add`.
3. Under `Story Formats` select Trialogue.

### Create your first chat story

![trialogue create](/docs/trialogue-create.gif)

1. Create a story in the Twine editor.
2. Edit the start passage to include:
   - Title (e.g. start)
   - Passage text (e.g. "Hi üëã")
   - One or more links (e.g. `[[What's your name?]]`)
   - Speaker tag (e.g. `speaker-bot`). This will display the speaker's name (in this case `bot`) in above their passages. It also sets a `data-speaker="bot"` attribute on the passage's HTML element, which can be used for styling.
3. Edit the newly created passage(s) to include:
   - Passage text (e.g. "My name is Bot")
   - One or more links (e.g. `[[Back to start->start]]`)
   - Speaker tag (e.g. `speaker-bot`)
4. Hit `Play` to test the result (should look something [like this](https://phivk.github.io/trialogue/docs/trialogue-demo.html))

## Editing styles

The way to edit styling is by choosing 'Edit Story Stylesheet' in the story menu:

### Changing UI colours

Trialogue uses [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) to set the main colours of the app. You can add the following to your Story Stylesheet and tweak the colours to fit your needs:

```css
:root {
    --bg-color: #C7BDB5;
    --user-color: purple;
    --speaker-color: #A00;
    --sidebar-bg-color: #FFF;
    --navbar-bg-color: #FFF;
    --passage-bg-color: #FFF;
    --passage-text-color: #000;
}
```

### Setting speaker avatars and colours

Setting **avatar image** and **text color** of a bot speaker with the name `bot` (passages tagged `speaker-bot`):
```
.chat-passage-wrapper[data-speaker='bot']:before {
  background-image: url('https://placekitten.com/100/100');
}
.chat-passage-wrapper[data-speaker='bot'] .chat-passage::before {
  color: green;
}
```

Setting the **avatar image** and **text color** of user passages:
```
.chat-passage-wrapper[data-speaker='you']:after {
  background-image: url('https://placekitten.com/100/100');
}
.chat-passage-wrapper[data-speaker='you'] .chat-passage::before {
  color: red;
}
```

Use any [valid CSS color value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color) for the color property.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Changes From Paloma

- Changed chat layout, including rendering links in separate UserResponsePanel
- Added speaker tags; every passage must have one tag starting with "speaker-" (e.g. "speaker-bot" or "speaker-president").
- Added helper function to show a passage delayed based on it's text length `story.showDelayed(idOrName);`. This is helpful to display a next passage without requiring user input, e.g. have two bot speakers reply to each other. Add this code to the passage text:

```
<%
story.showDelayed("idOrName");
%>
```

## Development Setup

A possible workflow for collaboration between a Story Author and Format Developer:

1. Story Author works on story in [Twinery GUI](https://twinery.org/2/#!/stories), with current version of published Story Format selected
2. Story Author exports updated version of Story to `.html` file and shares it with Format Developer *(infrequently)*
3. Format Developer decompiles the latest Story version from `.html` to `.twee` using [TweeGo](https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/)/[Twee2](https://dan-q.github.io/twee2/) *(see 'Testing during development')*
4. Format Developer runs [TweeGo](https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/)/[Twee2](https://dan-q.github.io/twee2/) to compile the latest Story from `.twee` to `.html` with WIP/'in development' version of custom Story Format *(see 'Testing during development')*
5. Format Developer adjusts Story Format *(frequently)*
6. Format Developer repeats from step **4.** until happy to release a new version of Story Format
7. Format Developer publishes Story Format as a new version *(infrequently)*
8. Story Author imports the new version of the Story Format and continues working on the Story
9. Repeat from **1.** until happy with Story Format functionality
10. üéâ

### Testing during development

#### Building Story Format from Source

Run `npm install` to install dependencies.  Run `grunt package` to create a release version for Twine under `dist/`.  Run `grunt --help` to list other grunt targets.

#### Compiling a story using Trialogue

A way to test the result of adjustments to the Story Format, is to compile a `.twee` Story to `.html` using the Trialogue format and check the behaviour & styling in a browser.

(De)compilation can be done using either:

- [TweeGo](https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/)
- [Twee2](https://dan-q.github.io/twee2/)

**Decompile** `.html` story to `.twee`/`.tw2` using Trialogue Story Format:

```
tweego --decompile --output=[path/to/target.twee] [path/to/source.html] --format=Trialogue
```

```
twee2 decompile [path/to/source.html] [path/to/target.tw2]
```

**Compile** `.twee`/`.tw2` story to `.html` story using Trialogue Story Format:

```
tweego --output=[path/to/target.html] [path/to/source.twee] --format=Trialogue
```

```
twee2 build [path/to/source.tw2] [path/to/target.html] --format=./dist/Twine2/Trialogue
```

# Paloma

Trialogue is based on [Paloma](http://mcdemarco.net/tools/scree/paloma/) by M. C. DeMarco: a Jonah-style Story Format for Twine 1 and 2 based on [Snowman](https://github.com/videlais/snowman) by [Chris Klimas](https://github.com/klembot).
